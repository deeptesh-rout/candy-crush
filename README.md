# candy-crush
A vanilla JavaScript Game inspired by Candy Crush 

 

This walkthrough is great as it will show you how to drag and drop elements in JavaScript. 
This is a very popular element in building many JavaScript projects.

In addition to this, we will also be practising using inbuilt methods such as:

- addEventListener()
- setAttribute()
- setInterval()
- some()
- every()
- forEach()
- includes()
- contains()
- add()
- remove()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- push()
- continue

And many more.
